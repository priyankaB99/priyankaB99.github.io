### Abstract

This researched argument essay grapples with one of the most difficult questions in the field of
foodways: what does ethnic authenticity (in a culinary context) truly mean? In it, the author
argues that the term is widely misunderstood and usually comes from a Euro-American, coded
white, racialized point of view that colors how consumers see other cultures. Ultimately, the
author contends that "limiting restaurants to what is often a subjective definition of 'ethnic
authenticity' damages cultural understanding and bolsters stereotypes." In other words,
globalization and culinary fusion have had a profound effect on how we define and understand
other cultural identities, particularly with those who have been historically oppressed. This
oppression continues in the form of racial stereotyping and an expectation of cheap restaurant
fare (Chinese food is used as one of a few examples).

Further, rather than challenging these preconceived notions about culture, so-called ethnic
restaurants entrench culinary and cultural expectations. Using a 2018 gastronomic preservation
project, sociological and cultural studies research, and San Francisco as a metropolitan case
study, the author concludes that "instead, it is the conscious pursuit of culinary fusion
combined with time that elevates multicultural awareness in society the most," preserving both
culinary tradition and cultural understanding
