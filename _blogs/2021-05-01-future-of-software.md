### Executive Summary

Low Code/No Code (LCNC) development platforms have climbed in popularity in the last few years and are helping to address the global software developer shortage. By allowing users to build complex applications with intuitive user interfaces rather than code, these platforms are democratizing software development. LCNC platforms are increasingly being employed by companies, startups, and organizations of all types, with 65% of all app development and 66% of major companies expected to rely on LCNC platforms by 2024.

This report will cover the rise and basic function of LCNC platforms. It will also provide an overview of the current major players in the LCNC industry and detail the primary advantages and limitations of most LCNC platforms. Finally, this report will explore the implications of these platforms on software development and the future of innovation, providing recommended next steps for how software developers can approach LCNC platforms.

Most of these platforms work by abstracting underlying code with visual tools such as drag and drop components, widgets, automations, and customizable functions that users can visually arrange into workflows and apps. Despite the diverse array of platforms and LCNC functionality available, general LCNC platforms allow users to build apps that fall into three categories: Web applications and websites, mobile apps, and back-office workflow apps. LCNC platforms will have a significant impact on the future of software development and work—bringing innovation closer to end users than ever before. They can help organizations expand collaboration, creativity, and efficiency while reducing costs.

Finally, this report examines the impact LCNC platforms will have on software developer roles and concludes that LCNC platforms do not pose a significant negative threat for the foreseeable future because of considerable functional limitations. Current and aspiring software developers should engage thoughtfully with LCNC platforms and implement them into their workflows; this will not only give developers more free time to focus on other tasks, but it will also allow them to expand their skill sets. Ultimately, LCNC platforms have the potential to make non-developers and developers alike more productive, efficient, and innovative.
