God, if you're into that sort of thing, may have drafted this universe in a series of broad, perfect strokes that never needed retouching. In this theoretical reality, the design of the trees, the fire ant, the geometry of the planets, were all perfect on the first try. Aah. 

On social media, it seems as though achievements are acquired in **grand, one-stroke gestures**. The first time I start an essay, the first website I design, the first blog post I publish, they must be perfect in every sense of the word. 

**I am starting this daily blog to practice thinking.** To practice putting out imperfect, half-finished work and allowing my focus to rest on the thought behind the work rather than the work itself. For my whole life, I have feared the *final product* so much that it's prevented me from putting the work in. It's prevented me from exploring topics and ideas that sit forever in the periphery of my thoughts. 

Through this blog, I want to reach into that periphery. 

"It's so much more effective to perform a small action often rather than a perfect action sometimes." - Sadia from *Pick Up Limes*
